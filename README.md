# Predict Success of Bank Telemarketing

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook(s) for analyzing and building machine learning models to predict the success of bank telemarketing campaigns.

Overview

- Goal: Explore telemarketing campaign data, perform feature engineering, train and evaluate classification models, and compare performance to determine which approaches work best for predicting campaign success.
- Contents: interactive Jupyter Notebook(s) that include data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.


   # Common libraries used in these notebooks
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter notebook

   If the notebooks use additional libraries (e.g., xgboost, lightgbm, imbalanced-learn), install them as needed:

   pip install xgboost lightgbm imbalanced-learn



Using Google Colab

- You can upload the notebooks to Google Colab and run them there. If your data is local, you can either upload the dataset to Colab or mount Google Drive.

Dataset

- The notebooks reference a bank telemarketing dataset. If the dataset is not included in this repository, check the notebook(s) for download instructions or place your dataset files in a `data/` directory and update the notebook paths accordingly.
